			<h3>I love numbers</h3>
			<p>My vision is to provide academics and non-academics with theoretical, programming and interpretational support in understanding data.  This involves operationalize their question of interest, identifying the appropriate statistical analysis, conducting and interpreting analyses/findings.  I care about data integrity, statistical assumptions, and the inferences made from the results knowing full well the findings can lead to real ramifications in the world.<br><br>I am based in Milwaukee, WI

			<h3>Tavinder K. Ark</h3>
			<p>Data Scientist.<br><br>I obtained my PhD from the University of British Columbia in the Measurement, Evaluation and Research Methodology program, and my Masters in Science from McMaster University in Psychology with a specialization in human cognition and medical education.  I have had the privilege of teaching introductory statistics, reliability, validity, and Generalizability Theory to senior graduate students and professionals.  You only know something if you can teach it.  I recognizes the importance of being able to communicate complex statistical analyses in a way that everyone can understand. <br><br>I have over 10+ years of experience in a wide range of areas, with a focus on medical education, outcomes and health research.  My love for numbers and modeling techniques gets me up in the morning, always looking for new ways to apply my knowledge in helping those who appreciate statistics and require a helping hand.  I not only bring strong analytic skills to any project, but humour as well knowing one learns and works best when everyone is smiling.

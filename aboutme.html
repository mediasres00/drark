			<h3>Tavinder K. Ark</h3>
			<p>Just shy of a random number generator, but more than the 'tab' on your keyboard.<br><br>I obtained my PhD from the University of British Columbia in the Measurement, Evaluation and Research Methodology program, and my Masters in Science from McMaster University in Psychology with a specialization in human cognition and medical education.  I say all this so when kids wonder why I cannot sing, dance or put words together in a sentence, they'll realize I spent too much time learning things that would pay my bills from actual life skills.  <br><br>I have over 10+ years of experience in a wide range of areas that are not useful on a daily basis.  My love for coffee, exploring, and making things with computers gets me up in the morning and excited for the world.  I'm always looking for ways to make things to stop me from being bored, and only care to be around a handful of people who are climbing some amazing hills in life that I'm happy to be part of.<br><br><h4>I do a lot of silly things, other than make silly websites, like fall off bikes and scrape your tweets!</h4><br><br>

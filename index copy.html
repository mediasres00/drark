				<p>We are in an era of collecting data.  A lot can be learned from data, but often we do not know what to 'ask' of our data, how to analyze or interpret it to make informed decisions, and more importantly what data to collect.<br><br>We also overlook the value and time required in cleaning, preparation and data management strategies that facilitate a wide variety of data analyses in an systematic and efficient manner.

			<h3>Data Collection</h3>
			<p>Being skilled at designing surveys, research studies and outcomes measures is vital to examine associations between variables, test theoretical models and make causal claims. Gathering data for the sake of collating only take you so far.  Without intention and research design, important variables can be missed or captured in a biased fashion.

			<h3>Data Preparation and Analysis</h3>
			<p>Data cleaning is a messy affair and descriptive statistics is boring.  Translation of statistical theory into code is difficult and vital for the growth of statistics.  All are rarely discussed, and yet it is the backbone of any good data analysis.

			<h3>Data Linkage</h3>
			<p>The ability to link datasets can provide valuable insight that could not be achieved if the datasets are kept separate.  To facilitate the linkage of data, gathering important variables (referred to as unique and/or direct identifiers) is essential during the data collection phase and should not be overlooked.  Ensure the collection and use of these unique identifiers for data linkage are allowed legislative, and the storage meets security and privacy standards.

			<h3>The Data Story</h3>
			<p>As a person who loves number, I  wish data on its own was memorable, but it is not.   The value of the data can be found in the story, context and the representation of the numbers that speaks to the audience.

		<h1>Data Visualiztion</h1>
			Representing data graphically aids our interpretation and provides an accessible way to discover patterns by leveraging our innate cognitive and perceptual strategies.  Finding the most effective strategy has been a focus of research across a wide variety of fields.  One of the first step involves identifying the important data points that you want to communicate with your audience.  All data visualizations should go through a production cycle with mockups, testing and refinement before finalization.﻿​<br><br>Remember to test your visualizations before finalizing.

			<p>The goal of this website is to provide some insight that I have learned over the years around data management, analysis and visualization.  As the amount of data increases, data can feel unwieldily.  The biggest struggle is knowing what statistical analysis to conduct in a landscape of new emerging techniques and encompassed by terms like ’machine learning.’   Keep in mind, everything in the end is just regression.  Remember Occam's razor when thinking through your analysis.  Try not to forget the assumptions of any statistical test, and do your best to test them or at least reference them.<br><br>I hope to provide some interesting data visualization techniques, interesting things I have come across, useful code snippets for data cleaning, preparation as well as disagreeable commentary on the current affairs and landscape of data analysis, statiscis, pyschometrics, and data management.
